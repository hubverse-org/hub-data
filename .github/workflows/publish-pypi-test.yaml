# .github/workflows/publish-pypi-test.yml

# Publish to test-pypi after a merge to the repository's main branch

# This workflow uses PyPI's trusted publisher feature to publish the package
# to test-pypi. The trusted publisher enables test-pypi updates without needing
# to store secrets in the repository.
# There are two prerequisites:
# 1. Create a GitHub environment named `test-pypi` in the project's repository
# (if you use a different environment name, change the environment name below to match)
# 2. Set up a trusted publisher on test PyPI for the project
# Note: the test.pypi.org url in the publish-to-testpypi job should be set to the name of
# your package on test PyPI.

# Full documentation about this process:
# https://packaging.python.org/en/latest/guides/publishing-package-distribution-releases-using-github-actions-ci-cd-workflows/
