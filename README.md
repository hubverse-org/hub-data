# hubdata

The goal of hubdata is to provide tools for accessing and working with hubverse Hub data using Python.

This package is part of the [hubverse](https://hubverse.io/) ecosystem, which aims to provide a set of tools for infectious disease modeling hubs to share and collaborate on their work.

## Introduction

This package's objective is to implement a minimum viable product (MVP) Python version of the hubverse's [hubData R package](https://hubverse-org.github.io/hubData/). Our initial users are hubverse developers working on internal Python tools, plus hubverse partners who wish to access data from Python programs.
